"""UB CSE Python coding style example.

This file contains the UB CSE coding style for Python.  It is rather
straightforward, as it incorporates directly
PEP 8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for basic formatting
and PEP 257 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for
documentation.  You should read and understand those documents.

Every file should have the author and contact point (e.g., email
address) in a comment on the first line, and its first statement should
be a PEP 257 doc string (like this one) describing the file contents.
